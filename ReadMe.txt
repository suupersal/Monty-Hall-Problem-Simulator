This is a simulator to show that the correct solution to the famous Monty Hall problem is indeed 66% and not 50%.

The simulator follows the rules of the newest Monty Hall problem published, where the host knows where the car is.

More info on this problem can be found at:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem

By default the simulator runs 100,000 rounds.
